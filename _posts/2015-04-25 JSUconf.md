# unconference
it is my first time attending an unconference. good concept. still waiting for a speaker not that nervous. it seems like the speaker using the conference for training their talks for bigger conferences. it is not bad though. it is just a little more work to listen to untrained speakers. not that i am a better speaker. definitely not. you can see this in my own talk n youtube.

the topic are most quite basic. so some of them i could jump in and held the talk spontanously. which actually seems pretty normal, because some speakers did not show up and just someone from the audience jumped in and taken over the talk. this is verry exciting.

happy to visit some more unconfences in the future.
