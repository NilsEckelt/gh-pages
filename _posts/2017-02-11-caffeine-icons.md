# What to do about crappy icons

...replace them.

[Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) is a good tool for mac to prevent it from falling asleed &mdash e.g.
during a presentation. But as a designer I can't stand ugly icons. Luckily there
is a way to prevent my eyes from bleeding.

Find the tool in the applications folder, _right click > Show package contents > Contents > Resources_
and there they are, my small little biests.

I made my own versions of it

[![active](/download/caffeine/active-preview.jpg)](/download/caffeine/active@2x.png)
[![inactive](/download/caffeine/inactive-preview.jpg)](/download/caffeine/inactive@2x.png)

and saved them as [`active@2x.png`](/download/caffeine/active@2x.png) and [`inactive@2x.png`](/download/caffeine/inactive@2x.png) (I doubled the size and because I live in the retina generation were apple calls high-res `@2x` or
`@3x`, I had to rename the files ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )

Move these files to the resources folder, restart _caffeine_ and voilà

Thanks for reading.
