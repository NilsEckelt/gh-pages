When you come to a point, that you have multiple stakeholders which have most of the time different opinions, then you will most probably find you self stuck into discussions when you ask or-questions. The simple solution: Do not ask or-questions. You have two similar good solutions for a task and you want to show them.

So what I've done so far:

"Do you want A or B?"
95% of the time this leads into discussion, which leads into C.

What I do now instead:

"Do you like that?" _show A._ -&gt; When 'yes', you are fine. When 'no', show B.
Actually, now I'm also have from time to time the discussion about a solution like C, but it became pretty rare.
