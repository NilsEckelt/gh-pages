description: Some thoughts about our economy, a base income for everybody and how this could work
---
I'm a happy person. What I do for the living is what I would do anyway. It's my hobby. It's fun to me. And getting paid for it should basically just pay my bills.

Fun fact: the more it make me fun, the better the opportunities get to do fun stuff, the higher my payments increases.
This is true for most kind of creative jobs. Musicians, painters, authors, bloggers, cooks, gardeners, architects, every kind of artists.
I refer to these as the jobs that we wanna do.

And there are these other jobs. Jobs that needs to be done. Fabric workers, miners, farmers, drivers, cashiers, waiters...

I don't say they do not or can not love their job, but it might be for other reasons than the purpose of their job. As a taxi driver I might like the contract to people which I could also get with other jobs and it is just not necessary to be this specific one.

The second kind of jobs is the one we slowly get rid of, as the technology increases.
Today people are complaining what to do with all these people losing their job because of the automation of processes. If they've loved their job because of the purpose of the job I think it's valuable to keep them doing it cooperatively with robots. But if it's just for the need of an income, we should consider giving an income to everybody. We will reach this point anyway and it's time to get to there faster.

Think of it that way (hypothetically): with a incompromiseable minimum income everybody could do what they actually want to do. Including nothing at all.

Adding Ann additional income for serving the community (like doing stuff that needs to be done and is not yet automated or stuff that cannot be automated at all) you'll be able effort more than the people that do not have to do anything for their living.

But how much more should these people get?
Now comes the fun part: The minimum and the maximum incomes are valves you can use to adjust how high you raise the total luxury level  (minimum) and how many workers you need to drive the country (maximum). At some point the envyness of the people will drive them to do something for the community. We all are bitches. Admit it.

Let's repeat this shortly.
Stuff you wanna do: minimum income. Hobbyists do their stuff.
Stuff that needs to be done: maximum income. You can effort more then others. Woohoo.

The stuff that is currently done by politicians (thinking about the origin of the word) refers to the latter one.

Now the difficult thing about this utopia: How can we make all this being paid for?

Currently 1% of the people sharing 90% of the total income. The 1% of people is pretty mighty and powerful and loves to buy stuff they don't need and doesn't make them happy. But losing this privileged point is not easy. We (99%) must understand.

Okay. This idea sounds good. To good to be true. You can think of it any further. You can share the minimum income with more and more people by adjusting the minimum valve until we all becoming even. -- Woah. Wait a minute. That's totally sience fiction. Yes it is. Fiction. But where are the flaws.
