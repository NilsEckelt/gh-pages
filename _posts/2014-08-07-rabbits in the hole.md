When discussion run off topic, everyone in the meeting are allowed to raise a rabbit card to show, they think we are running in too much detail.

It can be a nice starting session to allow people to draw their own rabbit (hole) cards. We didn’t had the time for the session so I’ve made a few. Here are my examples.
