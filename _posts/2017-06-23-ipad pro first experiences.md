#My first days with the iPad Pro are quite amazing

I think of the iPad as of a obscure big iPhone - as a smartphone you can't do phone calls with. So is it a big smart?

At first I wanted to try the pencil. You might know, I reall like drawing. Any pen or pencil any surface. On the iPad there is this glass surface. It is really slippery. You can get used to it. I currently still prefer the paper feeling, but that might be behaviour and nothing else.

I was taking a picture from my stream - no, the iPad is not my camera replacement. I do not feel comfortable holding a slate in front of my face when taking a picture. Another habit of miene - and started drawing on it. It is surprisingly accurate, fast and feels naturally. My brain keeps on telling me, this is not real, because something is wrong and I cannot put my finger on what it is. Still can't. Sry.

After my first drawing session, it was time for some leassure time. Netflix, good. Amazon Prime, good.

Multitasking, astonishing. You are limited to two apps at a time! but that solves like 98% of the time. The rest might be habbit. And picture-in-picture, or pip for short, is a gimick I somewhat miss on my Desktop now.

Whi:e writing this post on my iPad I realise, the iPad does quite well on typing on the on sceen keyboard. Ten finger typing indeed possible. And it is fun.

And with the right tools, I can even upload this post to github and so I can push it to my website. I've just today changed my letsencrypt cronjob via a shell from the iPad. I am surprised this was even possible, But it was also quite comfortable.

I might update this article with more experieces. But to be honest, I'm not yet good in keeping my op&t coming our regulary. So don't wait for the updates.

Cheers! Thanks for reading,
 Nils
